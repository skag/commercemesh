# Commerce Mesh Protocol (CMP)

**CMP is an open protocol designed for the future of commerce.**  
It defines modular standards across four core nodes: **discover**, **transact**, **trust**, and **fulfillment** — enabling interoperable and agent-friendly commerce infrastructure.

## 🌍 Vision

Commerce is evolving.  
From AI-driven shopping to peer-to-peer transactions, the next era of commerce demands modular, programmable building blocks — not platforms.

CMP explores this future by defining a protocol-first foundation for how products are:
- **Discovered** across networks
- **Transacted** securely and transparently
- **Trusted** without centralized gatekeepers
- **Fulfilled** flexibly across supply chains

## 🚧 Status

This repo is a **work in progress**.  
We are currently in the **exploration phase**, prototyping early ideas for:
- Discovery feed formats and query schemas
- Transact APIs and payment commitments
- Trust models (escrow, identity, reputation)
- Fulfillment event hooks and routing logic

Expect drafts, iterations, and changes as the protocol takes shape.
